    abstract = { ABSTRACTMuch inter-intra-tester kinematic and kinetic repeatability research exists, with a paucity investigating inter-laboratory equivalence. The objective of this research was to evaluate the inter-laboratory equivalence between time varying unplanned kinematics and moments of unplanned sidestepping (UnSS). Eight elite female athletes completed an established UnSS procedure motion capture laboratories in the UK and Australia. Three dimensional time varying unplanned sidestepping joint kinematics and moments were compared. Discrete variables were change of direction angles and velocity. Waveform data were compared using mean differences, 1D 95\%CI and RMSE. Discrete variables were compared using 0D 95\% CI. The mean differences and 95\%CI for UnSS kinematics broadly supported equivalence between laboratories (RMSE≤5.1°). Excluding hip flexion/extension moments (RMSE = 1.04 Nm/kg), equivalence was also supported for time varying joint moments between laboratories (RMSE≤0.40 Nm/kg). Dependent variables typically used to characterise UnSS were also equivalent. When consistent experimental and modelling procedures are employed, consistent time varying UnSS lower limb joint kinematic and moment estimates between laboratories can be obtained. We therefore interpret these results as a support of equivalence, yet highlight the challenges of establishing between-laboratory experiments or data sharing, as well as establishing appropriate ranges of acceptable uncertainty. These findings are important for data sharing and multi-centre trials. }
