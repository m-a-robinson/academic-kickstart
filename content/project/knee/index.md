The Anterior Cruciate Ligament is a primary knee stabiliser that is most commonly injured during dynamic team sports e.g. soccer, handball, netball. This research theme focusses on the evaluation of biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors which are widely believed to be modifiable. Systematic reviews in each of these areas evaluated the current knowledge and quality of research indicating lack of consensus within the literature.

By challenging athletes performance during dynamic tasks such as sidestepping, jumping and landing and combining this with robust methods and novel techniques we establish new insights into ACL injury risk.
