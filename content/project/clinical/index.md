**Key collaborators:**

Prof. Gabor Barton - LJMU, Liverpool, UK.
A. Prof. Cyril J. Donnelly - Nanyang Technological University, Singapore

This research theme covers multiple projects demonstrating the breadth of applications for biomechanical approaches. Clinical applications include clinical gait analysis, chronic ankle instability, alkaptonuria (a rare genetic disease), scleroderma and spinal cord injury. Clinical collaborations are welcome - please get in contact with ideas for potential projects.

Mark's PhD evaluated tetraplegic reaching after tendon-transfer, a surgical procedure to restore active elbow extension [this project is no longer active].
